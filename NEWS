 0.4.2 ("Kill animals, or else they'll die!")

This release adds a shiny new right-click menu. It also requires Gtk 
now. And this Gtk shinyness allows:
- Disable audio during playback
- Shiny new properties dialog that allows downloading Flash files.
- Add a "no sound" backend for people that don't have ALSA.
- Fix bug that made the	image not redraw sometimes

 0.4.1 ("Nothing to see here")

This is just an update of the API to swfdec-0.4.1.

 0.4.0 ("They killed Kenny")

This is the first standalone release of the Swfdec Mozilla plugin.
The plugin has been completely rewritten. Major changes to the 0.3
version:
- The plugin is in-process for various reasons (This is important: 
  If the plugin crashes, your whole browser will crash)
- The plugin no longer uses GStreamer
- Audio is handled via ALSA (feel free to write plugins for other 
  audio outputs)
- Flash files will not be played by default, instead you will see
  a shaded pause sign (right-clicking toggles pause)

For now, this plugin will directly follow the swfdec library's 
version until its API somewhat stabilizes.
