 0.9.2 ("Hi new Kenny.")

Nothing new here:
- update build checks to 0.9

 0.8.2 ("Would you like a monkey claw?")

Oh, we need an update to a stable release. :(
- Fix crash when using Flashblock

 0.8.0 ("Best Friends Forever")

Second long-term of Swfdec, here we go:
- Add UI for handling autoplay to the right-click menu
- Bump reported version to 9.0r999
- Fix some rare crashers

 0.7.4 ("Whites won again")

Not much has happened here since the last release:
- update to changed APIs
- send proper HTTP headers
- HIG-improve the properties dialog

 0.7.2 ("Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?")

This release brings Swfdec ahead of the competition!
- support fullscreen
- remember files to be autoplayed
- implement windowless support in Firefox 3
- don't hang the browser on high-CPU files
- work in gtk-webkit
- make properties dialog more HIGgy

 0.6.0 ("It'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.")

And here's the first long-term release of Swfdec-mozilla.
- support missing plugins installation
- update API
- bugfixes galore

 0.5.90 ("Sticks and stones may break my bones")

We're getting close to 0.6:
- update API to new version
- resolve relative links correctly

 0.5.5 ("Reading is lame")

New release:
- update API for new version

 0.5.4 ("Ultravibe Pleasure 2000")

This release brings some stabiliy improvements.
- add FutureSplash mime type
- update API to match Swfdec
- some serious bugs fixed

 0.5.3 ("I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more than this stuff")

Another release of Swfdec, another release of the plugin.
- update API to match libswfdec
- new play icon

 0.5.2 ("Something you can do with your finger")

With keyboard support in Swfdec, it shouldn't be missed from the Mozilla plugin.
- implement keyboard interaction
- update to 0.5.2 API of Swfdec
- fix some bugs (including crashers)

 0.5.1 ("Kick the baby")

With Swfdec gaining support for the Stage actionscript object, some nifty new
features are in:
- implement "salign" and "scale" embed properties
- scale movie to correct size
- fix name to be 100% Adobe Flash compatible, so UFO detection script doesn't 
  barf

 0.5.0 ("Destroy all the old prints in celebration")

This is just a port of the API to Swfdec 0.5. The only feature is this:
- fix plugin to run with Firefox 3 alphas.

 0.4.5 ("Who's Jack?")

This release fixes the build system of the Mozilla plugin. Apparently neither 
Mozilla nor distros can provide a sane plugin API.

 0.4.4 ("The death camp of tolerance")

This release has a lot of internal changes that reduce memory usage and fix 
bugs. Among them:
- Fix Youtube videos sometimes not playing.
- Fix random crashes when visiting Flash-heavy sites
- Fix drawing glitches with fullscreen Flash files.
- Support for cursor changing.

 0.4.3 ("Now this puny world will bow down to me!")

This release includes some improvements to the properties dialog. It
also causes important bugfixes:
- Properly handle mouse movements
- Fix a nasty memory leak that made the Flash not go away anymore if
  the properties had been open.
- Update API.
Of course you can watch Youtube videos in Mozilla, too.

 0.4.2 ("Kill animals, or else they'll die!")

This release adds a shiny new right-click menu. It also requires Gtk 
now. And this Gtk shinyness allows:
- Disable audio during playback
- Shiny new properties dialog that allows downloading Flash files.
- Add a "no sound" backend for people that don't have ALSA.
- Fix bug that made the	image not redraw sometimes

 0.4.1 ("Nothing to see here")

This is just an update of the API to swfdec-0.4.1.

 0.4.0 ("They killed Kenny")

This is the first standalone release of the Swfdec Mozilla plugin.
The plugin has been completely rewritten. Major changes to the 0.3
version:
- The plugin is in-process for various reasons (This is important: 
  If the plugin crashes, your whole browser will crash)
- The plugin no longer uses GStreamer
- Audio is handled via ALSA (feel free to write plugins for other 
  audio outputs)
- Flash files will not be played by default, instead you will see
  a shaded pause sign (right-clicking toggles pause)

For now, this plugin will directly follow the swfdec library's 
version until its API somewhat stabilizes.
