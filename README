Swfdec is a decoder/renderer for Macromedia Flash animations.  The
decoding and rendering engine is provided in a library that can
be used by other applications.

This package contains a Mozilla plugin that uses the Swfdec library
for playing SWF files in a browser capable of loading NS-Plugins.

Notes:

 - If you install into /usr/local, your browser may have difficulty
   finding the plugin.  This can be solved for mozilla-based
   browsers by adding /usr/local/lib/mozilla/plugins to the
   MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.
 
 - Sound output is provided by libswfdec-gtk. It is currently only 
   available for ALSA. If you want a different output, feel 
   encouraged to provide patches.
