decoding and rendering engine is provided in a library that can
be used by other applications.

Notes:

 - If you install into /usr/local, your browser may have difficulty
   finding the plugin.  This can be solved for mozilla-based
   browsers by adding /usr/local/lib/mozilla/plugins to the
   MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.
